Assignment 4 Conclusions

Like Joe, I also had to relearn and understand heaps to implement this
assignment. I came to appreciate the simplicity and power of heaps
since they have so much utility for such a simple data structure. 

I also got to use GitHub and automated testing some more (although basic
since it was implemented using bash scripts), which was cool as a team.
