Joseph Leclercq
Assignment 4 Conclusions

Working on this lab allowed to me further understand the process behind
finding a MST. Before, I did not have a strong understanding of the 
algorithm, but the implementation forced me to learn it. Also, I had to
relearn heaps for this assignment, which I previously had forgotten. 
Overall, I mainly learned how to use graphs, and the way one is 
represented in code.
